# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central documentation for OctoAcme's project management processes. This README gives a concise orientation to our approach and direct links to the detailed process documents in this folder.

## Project management overview (brief)
OctoAcme delivers customer-first outcomes through iterative, data-informed delivery with clear roles and ownership. Our approach emphasizes:
- Customer focus and outcomes over outputs
- Iterative planning and small, testable deliveries
- Clear roles, decision rights, and accountability
- Measurable objectives and data-driven tradeoffs
- Proactive risk management and transparent communication
- Psychological safety and continuous improvement through retrospectives

Core lifecycle stages:
1. Initiation — define problem, outcomes, and stakeholders
2. Planning — scope, milestones, success metrics, resource planning
3. Execution & tracking — run increments, measure impact, and adapt
4. Release & deployment — validate and hand off to operations/customers
5. Retrospective & improvement — capture learnings and update processes
